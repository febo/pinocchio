//! A library to build a Solana program in Rust.
//!
//! This library is intended to be used by on-chain programs only. It provides
//! a zero-dependency library to minimise dependencies conflits. For off-chain
//! programs, use instead the [`solana-sdk`] crate, which re-exports all modules
//! from [`solana-program`].
