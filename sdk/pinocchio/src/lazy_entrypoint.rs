/// Declare the program entrypoint.
///
/// This entrypoint is defined as *lazy* because it does not read the accounts upfront
/// nor set up global handlers. Instead, it provides an [`InstructionContext`] to the
/// access input information on demand. This is useful when the program needs more control
/// over the compute units it uses. The trade-off is that the program is responsible for
/// managing potential duplicated accounts and set up a `global allocator`
/// and `panic handler`.
///
/// The usual use-case for a `lazy_entrypoint` is small programs with a single instruction.
/// For most use-cases, it is recommended to use the [`entrypoint`] macro instead.
///
/// This macro emits the boilerplate necessary to begin program execution, calling a
/// provided function to process the program instruction supplied by the runtime, and reporting
/// its result to the runtime.
///
/// The only argument is the name of a function with this type signature:
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn process_instruction(
///    mut context: InstructionContext, // wrapper around the input buffer
/// ) -> ProgramResult;
/// ```
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Defining an entrypoint and making it conditional on the `bpf-entrypoint` feature. Although
/// the `entrypoint` module is written inline in this example, it is common to put it into its
/// own file.
///
